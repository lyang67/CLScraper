      <p id="goodbye">This webapp is a wrapper around Craigslist, that allows you to search multiple cities at once.  Currently, Craigslist does not surface this capability.
        It was originally designed to search for vehicles across multiple cities.   For example, if you had a vehicle stolen,
      you could search across all nearby cities that do not require titles.  But it does work to search for any item so you don't have to go to every individual city Craigslist.</p>

      <p>This webapp was built on Ruby on Rails and is open source.  You can find the source code here:</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/lyang67/CLScraper">GitHub</a>
      <p>Feature requests can be sent to laurenyang67 {at} gmail {dot} com</p>

      <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Safety tips in case you find your stolen goods!  (This is in no way legal advice, proceed with caution)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>First of all, CALL YOUR LOCAL NON-EMERGENCY POLICE LINE for advice before proceeding!!!!!  You did file a case when your items were stolen, right?</li>
        <li>Contact the seller posing as an interested buyer, and arrange to meet in a public place</li>
        <li>Once you have ascertained that the item is yours, follow the police's advice to retrieve your item</li>
